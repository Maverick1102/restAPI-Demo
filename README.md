# restAPI-Demo
So you maybe have heard the term "restAPI" and "SOAP". If you're in the computing field, not knowing just highlights our languid attitude. 

This repo is a simple explanation and example of how restAPI works. It not really a high end or amazing thing. Heads up, there will be a massive lack of proper coding ethics because this is meant to just be an example of how restAPI's work. If you're expecting proper sanitization in code or whatever this is definitely not for you. But if you're here for just general knowledge, then get on board.


**What is a restAPI**
Its an application programming interface (API or web API) that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services. 

**How restAPI's work**
REST APIs communicate via HTTP requests to perform standard database functions like creating, reading, updating, and deleting records (also known as CRUD) within a resource. For example, a REST API would use a GET request to retrieve a record, a POST request to create one, a PUT request to update a record, and a DELETE request to delete one. All HTTP methods can be used in API calls. A well-designed REST API is similar to a website running in a web browser with built-in HTTP functionality.
